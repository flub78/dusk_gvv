# List of development errors

This is jst a list of errors which have slow down the development speed. I just hope that by keeping traces of them, they will be easier to avoid in the future

## wrong naming

Something has not the correct name inside a routine. In fact I reused the name used outside the routine and not the parameter name.

Solution : be consistent on naming across places.

## forgot to return the result ..
nothing to say.
  
## missing parenthesis

(signalled by VSC ...)

## interface

attempt to click on something not visible

## Call of the wrong method
type instead of select

## Context
use of $this in the wrong context

## Invisible characters

Non breaking spaces inside an input field.

## Exact comparison on float

Rounding has to be taken into account
